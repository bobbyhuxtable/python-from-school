write a script that:

Opens the file problem5.txt.
Counts each port and puts the results in a dictionary.






from collections import Counter
​
def count_ports(file_name):
    with open('problem5.txt', 'r') as f:
        port_count = Counter(line.strip() for line in f)
        print(port_count)
​
count_ports('/home/labsuser/problem5.txt')
Counter({'80': 7, '22': 5, '443': 3, '25': 3, '445': 3, '21': 2, '389': 1, '3389': 1, '': 1})
