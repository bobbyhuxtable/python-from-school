Write a program (using a function) that:

Asks the user for a long string containing multiple words.
Prints back the same string, except with the words in reverse order.
For example, if the user types the string: 'My name is robert', it will print 'robert is name My'.







def reverse_words(string):
    words = string.split()
    words.reverse()
    return ' '.join(words)
â€‹
string = input('Please enter a long string containing multiple words: ')
reversed_string = reverse_words(string)
print(f'The reversed string is: {reversed_string}')
Please enter a long string containing multiple words:  hello from earth from kasey
The reversed string is: kasey from earth from hello
