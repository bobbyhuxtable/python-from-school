Write a script using a function (dedupe) that:

Takes a list l = [1,5,7,2,4,3,5,1,6,2,6].
Returns a new list that contains all of the elements from the first list, excluding duplicates.






def dedupe(l):
    return list(set(l))
​
l = [1, 5, 7, 2, 4, 3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 6]
new_list = dedupe(l)
print(new_list)
​
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
